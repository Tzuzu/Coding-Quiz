## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to generate a quiz in which the user must complete within the time limit. Once the user completes the quiz, or the timer hits 0, they will be able to submit their score to the leaderboard, in which it automatically sort from highest to lowest score, with the ability to reset the leaderboard.

## What I've Learned

There is so much to JavaScript that I really still don't know about even after completing this assignment, but constantly adding things gets me in the habit of being able to read functions and knowing how to format them and how to name certain variables. I believe that mastering JavaScript will allow me to do a lot more with not only my career, but will also help with any personal projects that I decide to take on.
